How to test this code:

1. Download contents of folder
2. Open command prompt / bash shell inside folder
3. run the following command `pip install rich`
3. Type "python test.py"
4. If you don't get any errors, that means it works.

Code in test.py, Game.py, and Player.py should be very readable and English-like.

Still working on making the logic of Board.py more readable.
